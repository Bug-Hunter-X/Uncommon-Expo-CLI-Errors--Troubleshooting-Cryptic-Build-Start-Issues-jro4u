This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project. The exact cause can vary, but generally, it involves some kind of unexpected behavior during the build or start process. This might be due to issues with dependencies, misconfigurations in the project setup, or even problems with the Expo CLI itself.  It's often accompanied by a cryptic error message that doesn't point directly to the solution.
